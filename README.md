Plan Your Crawl:
A website that allows you to create a tour to all or some of the breweries in your area while having the ability to dress accordingly with the built in weather forecast.

## User Story
As someone looking to visit a new city, I want to enter that city into the application and find a list of breweries along with their location so that I can develop a route to visit different breweries and bottleshops in that city, and find the best route between them, along with the weather for that day.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a homepage with a form input
When I search for a city
Then I am presented with a list of brewery locations for that city
When I have this list
Then I can add them to a map to create a route
When I have created my route
Then I can store this as a saved route using local storage
When I search a city
Then I am also presented with the weather for that city
When I view the weather
Then I am presented with the weather conditions, the temperature, the UV index, the rain and the wind speed
When I click on a stored route
Then I am taken to the map of this route showing the locations on that route
