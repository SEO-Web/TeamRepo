Brewery crawl:

Website api openbrewerydb.org
Mvp - people wanting to do a pub crawl but don’t know where start or even where to go.

This app will show a list of breweries, types of breweries, phone number of said brewery  in the area you select and give you the fastest route from one to the next.
Build a map to show fastest route. 
Pdf share because local storage won’t share. 

- Share by appending the list of breweries to the query string? 

- Once you have your brewery crawl you can then share it with your friends on their socials.

- Background image taps, or beer etc something related. 

- Another page showing staged tours (previous tours) (two to a row)

## User Story
